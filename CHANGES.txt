Below are all of the changes. I couldn't complete the lab entirely, but
I feel like I was on the right track for much of it. The stumbling
blocks were clone() and join(), I think.

Makefile  - Removed forktest.c and added threadtest.c

types.h   - Added ticket lock

usys.S
user.h
syscall.h
syscall.c
sysproc.c - Added requisites for new system calls

proc.c    - Implementations of clone()* and join()*

ulib.c    - Implementations of thread_create(), thread_join(),
            lock_init(), lock_acquire(), lock_release()

threadstest.c   -   The testing function that spins off 10 threads which print out their thread number
                    and change a shared data structure. The locks mean that the structure will be ordered
                    at the end.


Ultimately, I had compilation problems, and perhaps some more problems with clone().
I had the idea as to what to change, but not necessarily all of the details such as
argument handling. With a "functional" clone, I think the lock and thread implementations
are correct.

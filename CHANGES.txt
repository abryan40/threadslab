Below are all of the changes. I couldn't complete the lab entirely, but
I feel like I was on the right track for much of it. The stumbling
blocks were clone() and join(), I think.

Makefile  - Removed forktest.c and added threadtest.c

usys.S
user.h
syscall.h
syscall.c
sysproc.c - Added requisites for new system calls

proc.c    - Implementations of clone() and join()

ulib.c    - Implementations of thread_create(), thread_join(),
            lock_init(), lock_acquire(), lock_release()
